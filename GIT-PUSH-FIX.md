# üîß Git Push Error - Resolution Steps

## Issue
```
! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
```

**Cause**: Remote repository has commits that aren't in your local repository.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Pull and Merge

### Step 1: Pull Remote Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

This will:
- Fetch remote changes
- Attempt to merge automatically
- May show merge conflicts if files overlap

### Step 2: Handle the Result

#### If Auto-Merge Succeeds ‚úÖ
```bash
# You'll see:
# Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
# X files changed, Y insertions(+), Z deletions(-)

# Now push:
git push origin main
```

#### If Merge Conflicts ‚ö†Ô∏è
```bash
# You'll see:
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit

# Check which files have conflicts:
git status

# Files with conflicts will be marked:
# both modified:   src/index.ts
# both modified:   src/config/env.ts
```

---

## üîÄ Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Needed)

### View Conflicts
```bash
# See all conflicted files
git status

# View a specific conflict
cat src/index.ts | grep -A5 -B5 "<<<<<<< HEAD"
```

### Conflict Markers Look Like
```typescript
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your local changes
const myCode = "local version";
=======
// Remote changes
const myCode = "remote version";
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

### Resolution Options

#### Option 1: Keep Your Changes
```bash
# For each conflicted file:
git checkout --ours src/index.ts
git add src/index.ts
```

#### Option 2: Keep Remote Changes
```bash
# For each conflicted file:
git checkout --theirs src/index.ts
git add src/index.ts
```

#### Option 3: Manual Edit
```bash
# Open file in editor
code src/index.ts

# Remove conflict markers and keep what you want:
# Delete: <<<<<<< HEAD
# Delete: =======
# Delete: >>>>>>> origin/main
# Keep the code you want

# Save and add
git add src/index.ts
```

### Complete the Merge
```bash
# After resolving all conflicts:
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
git push origin main
```

## üöÄ Alternative: Force Push (Use with Caution!)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This will overwrite remote changes!

Only use if:
- You're sure remote changes are not important
- You want your local version to be the source of truth
- You've checked with team members

```bash
git push --force origin main
```

**Better Alternative** (safer):
```bash
# Creates a new commit on remote
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

---

## üîç Recommended Approach

### Step-by-Step Commands

```bash
# 1. Save your current work just in case
git stash

# 2. Pull remote changes
git pull origin main --rebase

# 3. If rebase succeeds, restore your changes
git stash pop

# 4. Add and commit if needed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1+ Enhanced - Dashboard, CoinMarketCap, Discord Intelligence"

# 5. Push
git push origin main
```

### Why Rebase?
- Creates cleaner history
- Puts your commits on top of remote commits
- Avoids merge commits
- Preferred for single-developer projects

---

## üìã Quick Fix Commands

### Most Common Solution (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:\Users\PC\sonic-crypto-mcp-server

# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# If successful, push
git push origin main
```

### If That Fails
```bash
# Pull with merge
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts if prompted
# Then push
git push origin main
```

---

## üîé Investigate First (Optional)

Before pulling, see what's different:

```bash
# Fetch without merging
git fetch origin

# See what commits are on remote but not local
git log HEAD..origin/main

# See file differences
git diff HEAD origin/main

# See which files changed
git diff --name-only HEAD origin/main
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevent This in Future

### Always Pull Before Push
```bash
# Good workflow:
git pull origin main  # Get latest
git add .             # Stage changes
git commit -m "msg"   # Commit
git pull origin main  # Pull again (in case of new commits)
git push origin main  # Push
```

### Set Up Auto-Pull
```bash
# Configure Git to always rebase on pull
git config pull.rebase true

# Now 'git pull' will automatically rebase
```

---

## ‚úÖ Execute Now

Based on your situation, run this:

```bash
cd C:\Users\PC\sonic-crypto-mcp-server

# Option 1: Rebase (cleanest)
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main

# Option 2: Merge (if rebase fails)
git pull origin main
# Fix any conflicts if prompted
git push origin main

# Option 3: Force (if you're sure)
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## üêõ If Problems Persist

### Reset to Remote (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# BACKUP first!
cp -r src src_backup
cp -r *.md docs_backup/

# Reset to match remote exactly
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Restore your changes
cp -r src_backup/* src/
cp docs_backup/*.md .

# Now add and commit fresh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Phase 1+ Enhanced"
git push origin main
```

### Check Remote Status
```bash
# See remote branches
git remote -v

# Check remote HEAD
git ls-remote origin

# Verify you're tracking correct branch
git branch -vv
```

---

## üéØ The Fix (Right Now)

**Run these commands:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\PC\sonic-crypto-mcp-server

# Pull with rebase (cleanest option)
git pull --rebase origin main

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

**If that gives conflicts:**

```bash
# Accept all your changes (since this is your Phase 1+ work)
git checkout --ours .
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verify Success

After pushing:

```bash
# Check status
git status
# Should say: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"

# Verify remote
curl https://ss.srvcflo.com/health

# Check deployment logs
wrangler tail --format pretty
```
