```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Multi-source price fallback for cron jobs + Enhanced UI

- Modified refreshRecentData() to use Orderly → DexScreener → CoinDesk fallback
- Added new API endpoints for Orderly and DexScreener direct access
- Enhanced dashboard UI with data source badges (🔷 Orderly, 💎 DexScreener, 🏦 CoinDesk)
- Improved error handling and logging throughout
- Added comprehensive documentation (FIXES_APPLIED.md, DEPLOY.md, etc.)

Fixes:
- Cron jobs now succeed even when CoinDesk API returns 530 errors
- UI shows which data source provided each price
- Better error messages for missing API keys

Based on production logs showing:
✅ Orderly: BTC-USD = \$121661
✅ DexScreener: SONIC-USD = \$0.00008488"

## What Happens Next (Auto-Deploy)

### Cloudflare Worker Auto-Deploy Process:

**Minute 0:00** - Push received by GitHub
```
✓ Code pushed to main branch
✓ GitHub webhook triggers Cloudflare
```

**Minute 0:30** - Cloudflare starts build
```
→ Running: npm install
→ Running: npm run build (TypeScript compilation)
→ Building worker bundle
```

**Minute 1:00** - Build completes
```
✓ TypeScript compiled successfully
✓ Worker bundle created
✓ All checks passed
```

**Minute 1:30** - Deploy to production
```
→ Uploading worker to Cloudflare
→ Updating bindings (KV, R2, D1, etc.)
→ Activating new version
```

**Minute 2:00** - Live! 🎉
```
✓ Deployed to: https://ss.srvcflo.com/
✓ New version active
✓ Old version kept for rollback
```

---

## Verify Deployment

### 1. Wait 2-3 Minutes
Give Cloudflare time to build and deploy.

### 2. Check Health
```bash
curl https://ss.srvcflo.com/health
```

**Should Return:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T...",
  "services": {
    "ai": true,
    "kv": true,
    "r2": true,
    "d1": true,
    "analytics": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Price Endpoint
```bash
curl https://ss.srvcflo.com/api/price
```

**Should Return:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "data": [...],
    "sources_used": ["orderly", "dexscreener"]
  }
}
```

### 4. Check Dashboard
Open browser: **https://ss.srvcflo.com/**

**Should See:**
- Animated logo rainfall background
- Price card with data source badges
- Working AI chat
- No console errors (F12)

### 5. Monitor Logs
```bash
wrangler tail
```

**Look For:**
```
✅ Orderly: BTC-USD = $121661
✅ DexScreener: SONIC-USD = $0.00008488
✅ Price fetch: orderly, dexscreener
```

wrangler secret put BRAVE_API_KEY
```
Get key: https://brave.com/search/api/

### 2. Monitor Next Cron Run
Cron runs at:
- 8:00 AM UTC
- 12:00 PM UTC
- 8:00 PM UTC

Watch logs during next run:
```bash
wrangler tail --format pretty
```

Should see:
```
✅ Refreshed BTC-USD via orderly: $121661
✅ Refreshed ETH-USD via orderly: $3456.78
✅ Refreshed SONIC-USD via dexscreener: $0.00008488
```

### 3. Test All Endpoints
Run through the tests in `TESTING.md` against production URL.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Deployment Failed
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions (if configured)
# Visit: https://github.com/mintedmaterial/sonic-crypto-mcp-server/actions

# Or check Cloudflare dashboard
# Visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
```

### Dashboard Shows Errors
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
wrangler rollback

# Or redeploy manually
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Logs Show Errors
```bash
# View detailed logs
wrangler tail --format pretty

# Check specific error messages
# Most common: Missing secrets (BRAVE_API_KEY)
```

---

## Rollback Instructions (Emergency)

If deployment breaks production:

```bash
# Option 1: Git revert
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Wait for auto-deploy

# Option 2: Wrangler rollback
wrangler rollback
# Immediately reverts to previous version

# Option 3: Manual previous version
git log  # Find previous commit hash
git checkout <previous-hash>
wrangler deploy
```
