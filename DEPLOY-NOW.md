**Time Required:** 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Status:** Everything is ready! ✅

---

## Step 1: Commit & Push (2 minutes)

Open Git Bash or PowerShell in `C:\Users\PC\sonic-crypto-mcp-server` and run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Phase 1+ complete with all enhancements"
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

**✅ Success looks like:**
```
Enumerating objects: 50, done.
Writing objects: 100% (50/50), 150.00 KiB | 5.00 MiB/s, done.
To https://github.com/mintedmaterial/sonic-crypto-mcp-server.git
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main
```

**❌ If you see merge conflicts:**
```bash
# Accept their changes for documentation
git checkout --theirs *.md
# Keep your changes for source code  
git checkout --ours src/**/*
# Continue
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Watch Deployment (3 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://dash.cloudflare.com**
2. Click: **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Find: **sonic-crypto-mcp-server** or **coindesk-mcp**
4. Watch the deployment progress bar

**✅ Success looks like:**
- Green checkmark
- "Deployment successful"
- Status: "Active"

**Wait for this to complete before next step!**

---

## Step 3: Initialize Database (30 seconds)

Once deployment shows "successful", run this command:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://ss.srvcflo.com/api/init-db" -Method Post
```

**Git Bash/WSL:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ss.srvcflo.com/api/init-db
```

**✅ Success looks like:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database and credit tracking initialized successfully",
  "tables_created": ["instruments", "price_snapshots", "api_credit_usage"]
}
```

**❌ If you see error:**
- Wait 30 seconds and try again (deployment might still be propagating)
- Check Cloudflare dashboard shows "Active"

---

## Step 4: Run Tests (5 minutes)

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\test-endpoints.ps1
```

**Git Bash/WSL:**
```bash
bash test-endpoints.sh
```

**✅ Success looks like:**
- Health check: ✅ Status: healthy
- Database: ✅ Initialized
- Trending: ✅ Shows Sonic tokens
- Prices: ✅ Fetched successfully
- Global metrics: ✅ Market data displayed
- Dashboard: ✅ Accessible
- AI chat: ✅ Responds

**⚠️ Expected warnings:**
- Discord intel may show "unavailable" if token not set (this is OK)

---

## Step 5: Verify Dashboard (2 minutes)

1. **Open:** https://ss.srvcflo.com/
2. **Check:** 
   - ✅ Page loads without errors
   - ✅ Animated Sonic logos falling in background
   - ✅ Tabs are clickable (Overview, Charts, Trading, Intelligence, AI Chat)
   - ✅ "Top Sonic Gainers" shows data
   - ✅ "Live Sonic Prices" shows prices

3. **Test AI Chat:**
   - Click "💬 AI Chat" tab
   - Type: "What is Bitcoin?"
   - Press Enter or click Send
   - ✅ Should get a response within 3 seconds

4. **Open Browser Console (F12):**
   - ✅ No red errors (warnings are OK)

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment

**Real-time logs:**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Step 1 fails with "rejected"
**Fix:** Run `git pull origin main --rebase` first, then try again

### Issue: Step 3 returns 500 error
**Fix:** 
1. Check deployment is "Active" in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Wait 1 minute for Workers to fully deploy
3. Try init-db again

### Issue: Step 4 shows "no data" for trending
**Fix:**
1. Check CoinMarketCap API key is set: `wrangler secret list`
2. Try accessing directly: `curl "https://ss.srvcflo.com/api/trending?source=sonic"`
3. Check logs: `wrangler tail`

### Issue: Dashboard shows blank page
**Fix:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Check deployment completed successfully in Cloudflare

### Issue: AI chat doesn't respond
**Fix:**
1. Check AI binding in wrangler.toml (should be `[ai] binding = "AI"`)
2. Verify `/api/chat` endpoint works: `curl -X POST https://ss.srvcflo.com/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"test"}'`
3. Check Cloudflare AI quota (free tier: 10,000 neurons/day)
