## How It Works

### User Flow:
```
User: "What's the price of BTC?"
    ↓
Agent analyzes intent → "price_query" with entity "BTC"
    ↓
Agent selects tool → get_latest_index_tick(["BTC-USD"])
    ↓
Tool executes → Returns price data from Orderly
    ↓
Agent synthesizes response with data
    ↓
"BTC is currently at $121,661 (↑2.3%) according to Orderly DEX"
    + Tool badge: "💹 Get Latest Index Tick"
    + Citation: "Get Latest Index Tick - 10:23 AM"
```

### Technical Flow:
```typescript
1. AgentService.chat(message, history)
   ↓
2. analyzeIntent(message)
   - Uses Cloudflare AI to understand what user wants
   - Extracts entities (BTC, ETH, etc.)
   - Determines intent (price_query, sentiment_analysis, etc.)
   ↓
3. selectTools(message, intent)
   - Maps intent to appropriate tools
   - Builds tool call arguments
   ↓
4. executeTools(toolCalls)
   - Runs all tools in parallel
   - Handles errors gracefully
   ↓
5. generateResponse(message, toolResults, history)
   - AI synthesizes response using tool data
   - Includes specific numbers and sources
   ↓
6. Return AgentResponse
   - message: AI-generated response
   - tools_used: ["get_latest_index_tick"]
   - data: Raw tool results
   - citations: Source references
```

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Simple Price Query
```
User: "What's BTC at?"

Agent:
  Intent: price_query
  Entities: [BTC]
  Tool: get_latest_index_tick(["BTC-USD"])

Response: "BTC is currently trading at $121,661, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours. 
The data shows strong buying pressure with $2.1B in volume.

📊 Data source: 💹 Get Latest Index Tick
📚 Source: Orderly DEX, 10:23 AM"
```

### Example 2: Investment Advice
```
User: "Should I buy S token now?"

Agent:
  Intent: sentiment_analysis
  Entities: [S]
  Tools: 
    - get_latest_index_tick(["S-USD"])
    - analyze_sonic_market_sentiment(["S-USD"])

Response: "S-USD is currently at $0.956 with BULLISH sentiment (82% confidence).

Analysis:
- Price: +5.2% today
- Volume: $1.2M (above average)
- Trend: Upward momentum
- Risk level: Medium

⚠️ Investment Considerations:
While sentiment is positive, crypto markets are volatile. Consider:
1. Dollar-cost averaging over time
2. Only invest what you can afford to lose
3. Set stop-loss orders for risk management

```bash
# 1. Build
npm run build

# 2. Start server
npm run dev

# 3. Test in browser
http://localhost:8787/

# 4. Try these questions:
- "What's the price of BTC?"
- "Should I buy ETH?"
- "Compare BTC and S token"
```

### API Testing:
```bash
# Test agent endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "What is the current price of BTC?",
    "history": []

## Performance

### Speed:
- Intent analysis: ~500ms
- Tool execution: ~1-2s (parallel)
- Response generation: ~1s
- **Total: 2.5-3.5s** ✅

### Token Usage:
- Intent analysis: ~256 tokens

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

### Add CoinMarketCap Integration:
1. Create `src/services/coinmarketcap.ts`
2. Add `get_trending_crypto` tool
3. Register with AgentService
4. Update intent mapping for "trending_query"

### User will be able to ask:
- "What's trending today?"
- "Show me top gainers"
- "What's the fear and greed index?"

### Timeline:
- 2-3 days for CMC integration
- 1 day for testing
- 1 day for UI enhancements
